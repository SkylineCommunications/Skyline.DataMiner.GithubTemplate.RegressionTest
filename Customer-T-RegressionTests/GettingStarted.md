# Getting Started with Skyline DataMiner DevOps

Welcome to the Skyline DataMiner DevOps environment!
This quick-start guide will help you get up and running.
For more details and comprehensive instructions, please visit [DataMiner Docs](https://docs.dataminer.services/).

## Creating a DataMiner application package

This project is configured to create a .dmapp file every time you build the project.

When you compile or build the project, you will find the generated .dmapp in the standard output folder, which is typically the *bin* folder of your project.

When you publish the project, a corresponding item will be created in the online DataMiner Catalog.

## Adding extra artifacts in the same solution

You can right-click the solution and select *Add* > *New Project*. This will allow you to select DataMiner project templates (e.g. adding additional Automation scripts).

> [!NOTE]
> Connectors are currently not supported for this.

You can also add new projects by using the dotnet-cli. For the sake of stability, we recommend always using an *sln* solution with all projects included.

```bash
    dotnet new sln
    dotnet new dataminer-user-defined-api-project -o MyUserDefinedApiFromGithub -auth MyName
    dotnet sln add MyUserDefinedApiFromGithub
```

Every *Skyline.DataMiner.SDK* project within the solution, except other DataMiner package projects, will by default be included within the .dmapp created by this project. You can customize this behavior using the *PackageContent/ProjectReferences.xml* file. This allows you to add filters to include or exclude projects as needed.

## Importing from DataMiner

You can import specific items directly from a DataMiner Agent using DIS:

1. In Visual Studio, connect to an Agent via *Extensions* > *DIS* > *DMA* > *Connect*.

1. If your Agent is not listed, add it by going to *Extensions* > *DIS* > *Settings* and clicking *Add* on the DMA tab.

1. Once connected, import the DataMiner artifacts you want:

   1. In your *Solution Explorer*, navigate to folders such as *PackageContent/Dashboards* or *PackageContent/LowCodeApps*.
   1. Right-click, and select *Add*.
   1. Select e.g. *Import DataMiner Dashboard/Low-Code App*, depending on what you want to import.

## Adding content from the Catalog

You can reference and include additional content from the Catalog using the *PackageContent/CatalogReferences.xml* file provided in this project.

For the SDK to be able to download the referenced items from the Catalog, configure a user secret in Visual Studio:

1. Obtain an *Organization Key* from [admin.dataminer.services](https://admin.dataminer.services/) with the following scopes:
   - *Register catalog items*
   - *Read catalog items*
   - *Download catalog versions*

1. Securely store the key using Visual Studio User Secrets:

   1. Right-click the project and select *Manage User Secrets*.

   1. Add the key in the following format:

      ```json
      { 
        "skyline": {
          "sdk": {
            "dataminertoken": "MyKeyHere"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

## Executing additional code on installation

Open the `Customer-T-RegressionTests.cs` file to write custom installation code. Common actions include creating elements, services, or views.

> [!TIP]
> Type `clGetDms` in the .cs file and press Tab twice to insert a snippet that gives you access to the *IDms* classes, making DataMiner manipulation easier.

## Adding configuration files

If your installation code needs configuration files (e.g. .json, .xml), you can add these to the *SetupContent* folder, which can be accessed during installation.

Access them in your code using:

```csharp
string setupContentPath = installer.GetSetupContentDirectory();
```


## Publishing to the Catalog

This project was created with support for publishing to the DataMiner Catalog. You can publish your artifact manually through Visual Studio or by setting up a CI/CD workflow.
## Publishing to the Catalog with the complete CI/CD workflow

This project includes a comprehensive GitHub workflow that adheres to Skyline Communications' quality standards, including static code analysis, custom validation, and unit testing.

1. Make sure you have a **SonarCloud organization**.

   If you do not have one yet, you can create it on [sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/create-organization).

1. Create a GitHub repository by going to *Git* > *Create Git Repository* in Visual Studio, selecting GitHub, and filling in the wizard before clicking *Create and Push*.

1. In GitHub, go to the *Actions* tab.

1. Click the workflow run that failed (usually called *Add project files*).

1. Click the "build" step that failed and read the failing error.

   ``` text
   Error: DATAMINER_TOKEN is not set. Release not possible!
   Please create or re-use an admin.dataminer.services token by visiting: https://admin.dataminer.services/.
   Navigate to the right organization, then go to Keys and create or find a key with permissions Register catalog items, Download catalog versions, and Read catalog items.
   Copy the value of the token.
   Then set a DATAMINER_TOKEN secret in your repository settings: **Dynamic Link**
   ```

   You can use the links from the actual error to better address the next couple of steps.

1. Obtain an **organization key** from [admin.dataminer.services](https://admin.dataminer.services/) with the following scopes:

   - *Register catalog items*
   - *Read catalog items*
   - *Download catalog versions*

1. Add the key as a secret in your GitHub repository, by navigating to *Settings* > *Secrets and variables* > *Actions* and creating secrets or variables with the required names.

1. Re-run the workflow.

The following secrets and variables will have been added to your repository after all issues are resolved:

| Name            | Type    | Description                                        | Setup Guide                                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATAMINER_TOKEN` | Secret  | Organization key for downloading/publishing from/to the Catalog   | Obtain from [admin.dataminer.services](https://admin.dataminer.services/) and add it as a secret. |
| `SONAR_TOKEN`    | Secret  | Token for SonarCloud authentication               | Obtain from [SonarCloud Security](https://sonarcloud.io/account/security) and add it as a secret.  |
| `SONAR_NAME`     | Variable | SonarCloud project ID                            | Visit [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/projects/create), copy the project ID, and add it as a variable. |

### Releasing a version

1. Navigate to the *<> Code* tab in your GitHub repository.

1. In the menu on the right, select *Releases*.

1. Create a new release, select the desired version as a **tag**, and provide a title and description.

> [!NOTE]
> The description will be visible in the DataMiner Catalog.
